Our experimentation process strictly adheres to the evaluation module built into the LibCity package, ensuring consistency and comparability with other studies using this framework. 
We adopt the structure of LibCity atomic files and apply normalization techniques such as Z-score, min-max, or logarithmic normalization to prepare the data for model input.
